"Hangman" is a classic word game in which one player (in this case, the computer) thinks of a word, and the other tries to guess it by naming letters. For each mistake (an incorrectly named letter), a part of the stick figure's body is added to the gallows drawing. The goal of the guesser is to figure out the word before the stick figure is fully "hanged."
